1) How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

To create a hidden file or folder we should use mkdir command. In addition, after mkdir command we should write the name of folder. However, we should write . before the name of file or order to create a hidden file or folder.

For example, when we create a hidden folder which name is hiddenfolder, the command will be below:

mkdir .hiddenfolder 

Also for the second question, with ls -a command we can list hidden files or folders. If we use ls la command, the list will be detailed list.  

2) How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

To create multiple nested directories, we should use this command:'mkdir -p' In this command, mkdir refers to create a file and -p refers to the path. For instance, if we want to create multiple nested directories like in the question above, we should use this command:
mkdir -p /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3)How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character?


I should use 'echo -e 'line1 \nline2 \nline3' >> file-name' 

In this command, echo displays the string.  \n refers to newline with backspace interpretor. -e treats new line from where it used. And >> takes to output of the command on the left' then appends it to the file on the right. 

If we do the example that you gave us, we can should write this command:

echo -e `first message \nsecond message' >> File
